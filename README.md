Meteor X3DOM integration demo
=================

[X3DOM](http://www.x3dom.org/) is a way to represent 3D scenes in the DOM and
[Meteor](http://meteor.com) makes it easy to update the DOM in reaction to changes in data.

When you use them together, you can easily create apps that have 3D features!

### Running the App

This uses the [x3dom](https://github.com/stubailo/meteor-x3dom) package from [Atmosphere](https://atmosphere.meteor.com/).

To run the app, first install [Meteorite](http://oortcloud.github.io/meteorite/), then run the app with the `mrt` command.
